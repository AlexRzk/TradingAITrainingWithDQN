# Deep Q-Learning Trading Bot with Binance Integration

A reinforcement learning-powered cryptocurrency trading system that leverages Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to learn optimal trading strategies using historical market data from Binance.

Key Features:
+ ðŸ§  Deep Reinforcement Learning - Implements DQN with experience replay and target network stabilization

+ ðŸ“ˆ Technical Analysis Integration - Utilizes 12 technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)

+ ðŸ’¹ Binance API Integration - Fetches real historical market data (supports any Binance trading pair)

+ ðŸš€ GPU Acceleration - PyTorch implementation with CUDA support for faster training

+ ðŸ’° Virtual Trading Environment - Custom Gym environment with balance tracking and position management

+ ðŸ”„ Model Persistence - Automatic checkpoint saving and model reload capabilities

Technical Components:
1. Custom Trading Environment (TradingEnv)
   - Action space: Hold/Buy/Sell
   - Observation space: 12 normalized technical indicators
   - Profit-based reward system

2. Neural Network Architecture
      - 3-layer fully connected network (128-128 nodes)
     - Experience replay buffer (10,000 memory capacity)
     - Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy

3. Training Infrastructure
     - Periodic model checkpointing
     - Target network synchronization
     - Automatic GPU utilization
